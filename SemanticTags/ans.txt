Q.1 What are the new things introduced in HML5!

Ans :- HTML5 : HTML5 is the latest version of HTML and includes new features that allow web developers to create more interactive and engaging content for the web.

    Advantages of HTML5 :
    1. There are many attributes present in HTML5 that were not present in HTML.
    E.g., data-, offline, anabort, onblur  etc.

    2. It provides support for audio, video, and other multimedia content by
    using tags like <audio>,<video>,<canvas>, etc.

    3. There are many page layout options available in HTML5. In HTML, you can
    only find page layout tags like div, span, etc. But in HTML5, there are many
    more tag options available like header, footer, article, section, etc.

    4. HTML5 supports Search Engine Optimisation(SEO). Search engine
    optimization helps the websites to know about the popularity of their
    content and also provides insights on how to improve the content to
    increase the traffic on the websites.

    Disadvantages of HTML5 :
    1. Can only be run on modern browsers. Not compatible with older versions
    of various browsers, e.g., Google Chrome version less than 60, Mozilla
    version 2 and 3.6, etc.

    2. There is no standard video format available. For example, H.264 video
    format is supported by all web browsers but not by Firefox; similarly, the
    Ogg Theory video format is supported by all web browsers but not by
    Explorer.

    3. The multi-platform support provided by HTML5 sometimes leads to more
    complex code. Also, it becomes necessary to run all web applications in
    all formats to check the credibility of the code.

    4. HTML5 is still in the development phase; therefore, it might appear that 
    a few features that worked before are not working now. Thus developers
    need to stay updated while using HTML5.
